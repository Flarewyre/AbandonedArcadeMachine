# [Forever Engine](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FunkinForever)
An open-source, modular, optimized, and HOPEFULLY easy to use [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) mod engine!
----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine is an open source modification of the Friday Night Funkin' engine. Forever Engine is not to be confused with its original name, FUNKIN FOREVER, which is now no longer the name of the engine. The reason this is important will have to do with future plans of ours, so stay tuned if you'd like to hear more about those ;)
----------------------------------------------
The Forever Engine is based off of the aforementioned [Friday Night Funkin' Source](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin). It's made to be more accessible and easier to build off of, as well as having a lot of quality of life changes and a much more focused direction on the more traditional feel of rhythm games, all while still keeping the same style and feel of Friday Night Funkin'. I know a lot of source codes are hard to work with for friday night funkin', usually very unoptimised or very unorganised, I wanted to fix both of these issues with Forever Engine and Funkin' Forever in the future. True to the spirit of [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com), Friday Night Funkin' should be accessible by everyone, both modders and gamers alike, and I wanted to make it my goal to fix a lot of the issues that prevented people from being able to use the base game's engine, as well as create a more polished engines, as I was unhappy with the current existing ones at the time.

**FOREVER ENGINE IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED ON DESKTOP! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CRASHES/PROBLEMS WITH HTML5, NOR AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING HTML5**

----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine FEATURES! - 
Noteskins,
Custom UIs,
Options Menu with FPS Capping and adjustments
A lot of modularity and freedom with options (hopefully in the future EVERYTHING will be toggleable)
A restructure and partial remake of the base game's source code
Source Code folder abstraction
More streamlined code (only having to set things in one place)
AND MORE!

I really wanted to make an FNF engine that was easier to work with than any other, mostly because I thought about how messy most other engines including the base game were. That doesn't mean Forever Engine is better than the base game however, Forever is only a tribute to Friday Night Funkin' and its modding community, a small project of mine that I hope people can find enjoyment and use out of!

I don't care how big this section gets over time, I will actually keep expanding it. People deserve credit for what they do!

[Yoshubs](https://github.com/Yoshubs) - made the engine. she just so happens to be very fucking stupid for accidentally pushing the martian mixtape source code into forever engine's base github page


[Pixloen](https://github.com/PixlJacket) - made a lot of the custom assets that forever engine uses, he also gave me a lot of general advice on how to improve the engine as well as his input on both how to improve upon the base game and how the input system felt and such. He basically co-owns the engine lmao

[Gedehari](https://github.com/gedehari) - Amazing dude who I just met a couple of days ago, but he knows what he's doing so well and it feels like we're good friends despite only having known each other for a couple of weeks. He helped with a lot of the code for streamlining things like the Freeplay Menu as well as explaining things like the note quants (with pixl). A lot of my most recent code is heavily based on his project, [Izzy Engine](https://github.com/gedehari/IzzyEngine), which he let me borrow a lot of aspects from which I still owe him for lmao. He's also helping with waveforms for the chart editor!

[Scarlett](https://github.com/SomeKitten) - Overall cool friend of mine who knows a lot about programming and math that has helped me out countless times, still going here helping me with pushes, commits, etc. She wrote the finalised math formula for the note quants and fixed the song name issue.

[Oneilr](https://oneilr.newgrounds.com/) - Cool Guy Oneilr, made some of the custom assets, mostly the animated ones like the custom note splashes to avoid the week 7 embargo as well as some other things like the checkmarks in the options menu.

[ImCodist](https://github.com/ImCodist) - helped with a couple of pull requests and issue fixes, but, I'm not gonna give him any credit at all, because he stole my obsidian soul in minecraft and I will never forgive him for that!!!!

[HelloSammu](https://github.com/hellosammu) - weird catgirl programmer, they scare me

[ninjamuffin99](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/) - HE MADE THE BASE GAME SO LIKE WITHOUT HIM THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE GO CHECK HIM OUT RIGHT NOW

[Fl0pD00dle](https://fl0pd00dle.newgrounds.com/) - Is making some custom assets in the future, is a really cool and underrated guy who's awesome to talk to and I hope he feels better soon. WHEN THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED HE'LL GET BUMPED TO CONTRIBUTOR

[HThagomizer](https://github.com/HThagomizer) - not MURDERING ME for accidentally pushing the martian mixtape source code

[Tsuraran](https://twitter.com/_Tsuraran) - DOPE ASS CUSTOM MENU MUSIC INCOMING, also made vs skipper with clockwerk which is fucking hilarious ALSO YEAH I'LL BUMP AS WELL AFTER ITS IN THE ENGINE

How to Compile:

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup.bat (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with fnf, this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.
If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!
